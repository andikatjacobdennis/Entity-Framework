# Entity Framework Practice Repository

Welcome to the Entity Framework Practice Repository! This repository contains a comprehensive guide and examples for working with Entity Framework (EF) in .NET applications. It covers setup, model definition, data seeding, migrations, repository patterns, and various loading techniques.

## Repository Structure

1. **[Setup_and_Installation.md](Setup_and_Installation.md)**: Instructions for setting up a .NET project with Entity Framework Core, including installation of necessary packages and tools.

2. **[Defining_Models.md](Defining_Models.md)**: Guidelines for creating model classes with data annotations and validation, including examples for defining entities and relationships.

3. **[DbContext_Configuration.md](DbContext_Configuration.md)**: Instructions for creating and configuring the `DbContext` class, including setting up the connection string and defining relationships between entities.

4. **[Creating_and_Applying_Migrations.md](Creating_and_Applying_Migrations.md)**: Steps to create and apply database migrations to update the schema based on model changes.

5. **[Repository_Pattern.md](Repository_Pattern.md)**: Implementation of the repository pattern, including generic repository interfaces and concrete implementations for data access.

6. **[Seeding_Data.md](Seeding_Data.md)**: Techniques for seeding initial data into the database using Entity Framework.

7. **[Loading_Techniques.md](Loading_Techniques.md)**: Examples and explanations of various EF loading techniques, including eager loading, lazy loading, and explicit loading.

8. **[Handling_Multiple_Levels.md](Handling_Multiple_Levels.md)**: Guide on retrieving and handling data with multiple levels of depth, including practical examples.

9. **[Testing_with_EF.md](Testing_with_EF.md)**: Approaches for testing EF-based applications, including unit testing with in-memory databases and mocking `DbContext`.

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Your Project

1. Open the [Setup_and_Installation.md](Setup_and_Installation.md) file.
2. Follow the instructions to create a new .NET project and install Entity Framework Core and relevant database providers.

### 2. Define Your Models

1. Refer to the [Defining_Models.md](Defining_Models.md) file to create model classes and apply data annotations and validation rules.
2. Define entity relationships and configure them in your models.

### 3. Configure Your DbContext

1. Open the [DbContext_Configuration.md](DbContext_Configuration.md) file.
2. Configure the `DbContext` class, including setting up the connection string and configuring entity relationships.

### 4. Create and Apply Migrations

1. Follow the steps in [Creating_and_Applying_Migrations.md](Creating_and_Applying_Migrations.md) to create and apply migrations for updating your database schema.

### 5. Implement the Repository Pattern

1. Review the [Repository_Pattern.md](Repository_Pattern.md) file for details on implementing the repository pattern for data access.
2. Create generic and specific repository implementations as needed.

### 6. Seed Your Data

1. Consult the [Seeding_Data.md](Seeding_Data.md) file to learn how to seed initial data into your database using EF.

### 7. Explore Loading Techniques

1. Open the [Loading_Techniques.md](Loading_Techniques.md) file to understand different loading techniques (eager, lazy, and explicit loading) and see examples of their usage.

### 8. Handle Multiple Levels of Data Retrieval

1. Refer to the [Handling_Multiple_Levels.md](Handling_Multiple_Levels.md) file for guidance on retrieving data with multiple levels of depth.

### 9. Test Your EF-based Application

1. Check the [Testing_with_EF.md](Testing_with_EF.md) file for strategies on testing Entity Framework applications, including unit tests with in-memory databases.
